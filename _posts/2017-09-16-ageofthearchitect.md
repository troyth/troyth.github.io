"And now we’re hacking human DNA. While we've been on the lookout for Roko's basilisk, the true singularity may have passed without a gasp.

Rather than aping the other side of the cave, we've begun to architect it." \(Columbia University, seminar, fall 2017 [🔗](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/sis_course_id:ARCHA6752_001_2017_3)\)
